                    <h2> Career Development </h2>
                    <p> The energy sector is a massive contributor to world GDP, and accounted for 2.2% of the total for the year 2016, 
                        according to International Energy Agency. </p>
                    <p> If you are planning to embark on a career in the oil and gas industry, or the wider energy sector, 
                        this industry offers a number of enticing benefits. </p>
                    <p> Salaries for this sector are typically higher than average, and this is due to several factors, 
                        such as the educational background required. However other incentives, such as lucrative financial bonuses,
                        will also come into play and make potentially remote working locations more attractive to workers. 
                        Individual salaries vary depending very much on experience levels and role-specific skills, though seldom start below £25k. 
                        Those in senior, or more skilled positions can command significantly higher pay. </p>
                    <p> Technology is integral to this industry, and as you progress along this path you will have opportunities to be trained regularly with cutting-edge equipment. 
                        Ensuring your skills are kept up to speed will contribute greatly to your career trajectory. </p>
                    <p> Travel possibilities are common, due to the global demand for these resources. 
                        The growing need for skilled professionals means this career choice gives you real geographic versatility – especially if you work off-shore! </p>
                    <p> Learning takes place at a continual rate in oil and gas careers. This sector is constantly evolving, and advancements in technology and practices are common, 
                        meaning you can expect to professionally develop alongside working. </p>
                    <p> Skills you can develop in this industry may be very specific, such as petroleum economics, oil and gas exploration management, 
                        refinery management, and operations material management. However you will also broaden your analytical, communication, and management abilities. </p>
